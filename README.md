- **Gemini AI Integration**: Powered by Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash for natural, empathetic interactions

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.24.2+
- MySQL 8.0+
- Google Gemini API key

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zjoart/eunoia.git
cd eunoia

# Install dependencies
make tidy

# Setup environment
cp .env.example .env

# Setup database
make migrate-up

# Run application
make run
```

## Configuration

Configure your `.env` file with required values. See [.env.example](.env.example) for all required variables including database credentials and Gemini API key.

## Commands

Run `make help` to see all available commands with descriptions.

### Key Commands

```bash
make run              # Start the application
make migrate-up       # Apply database migrations
make migrate-down     # Rollback migrations
make migrate-version  # Check migration status
make test             # Run all tests
make test-ci          # Run tests with race detection and coverage
```

## Testing

Eunoia includes comprehensive test coverage across all layers:

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests with race condition detection and coverage report
make test-ci

# Run tests without cache
make test-force

# Run tests with verbose output
make test-log

# Run specific test function
make test-function TEST=TestHandleA2AMessage_ValidRequest
```


## How It Works

### Intelligent Intent Detection

Eunoia automatically detects user intent and creates appropriate records:

**Mood Detection**: Recognizes emotional expressions
- "I'm feeling great today" → Creates check-in with mood score 8/10 (happy)
- "Feeling stressed and anxious" → Creates check-in with mood score 3/10 (anxious)

**Reflection Detection**: Identifies deeper thoughts (15+ words with reflection indicators)
- "Today I realized..." → Creates reflection with sentiment analysis
- "I've been thinking about..." → Stores reflection with AI-generated insights

### Platform Integration

Eunoia uses a platform-agnostic architecture with flexible metadata handling:

**Primary Endpoint:** `POST /a2a/agent/eunoia`  
**Protocol:** JSON-RPC 2.0  
**Agent Discovery:** `GET /.well-known/agent.json`

**Example Request:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "req-123",
  "method": "message/send",
  "params": {
    "message": {
      "kind": "message",
      "role": "user",
      "parts": [{"kind": "text", "text": "I'm feeling anxious today"}],
      "metadata": {
        "platform_user_id": "user-123",
        "platform_channel_id": "channel-456"
      },
      "messageId": "msg-789"
    }
  }
}
```

**Supported Metadata Keys:**
- User ID: `platform_user_id`, `telex_user_id`, or `user_id`
- Channel ID: `platform_channel_id`, `telex_channel_id`, or `channel_id`

### A2A Protocol Compliance

- Full JSON-RPC 2.0 specification adherence
- Proper error codes and structured responses
- Agent discovery via `.well-known/agent.json`
- Support for conversation history and context
